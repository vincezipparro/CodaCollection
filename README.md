# Coda Collection Coding Exercise

Using an automation framework of your choosing, create 3 automated tests to validate expected behavior against our web application (codacollection.co). Our expectation is that this exercise shouldn't take more than 30-60 minutes. Here are a few examples to help get you started:

- As a user, I would like to view a film page and navigate to its corresponding Amazon Prime Video page.
- As a potential Coda employee, I would like to view the QA Engineer job posting.
- As a user, I would like to be able to successfully subscribe to the Coda mailing list.
- As a user, I would like to view search results related to the band Radiohead.
